# Girls'Day @Scout24

[This](http://scout24.github.io/girls-day/) is the jekyll site for the (hopefully from now on) annual [Girls' Day](http://www.girls-day.de/)
at [ImmobilienScout24](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/) and [AutoScout24](https://www.autoscout24.de/).

Some of the content was created by girls who participated in our HTML/CSS introduction workshops.


## Running
This is a jekyll site.
You will need to [install the jekyll blog engine](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to build it.

The contents can be served with:

```bash
jekyll serve --watch
```

or by deploying to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

See the resulting web page locally on `http://localhost:4000/`.
